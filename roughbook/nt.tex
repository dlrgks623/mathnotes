\section{Elliptic curves}
\subsection{Reduction of Weierstrass equations}
In this subsection, we want to investigate the important constants of elliptic curves such as $c_4$, $c_6$, $\Delta$, $j$ by calculating equations with hands.

\textbf{Step 1.}
The Riemann-Roch theorem proves that every curve of genus 1 with a specified base point can be described by the first kind of Weierstrass equation.
Explicitly, the first form of Weierstrass equation is
\[y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6.\tag{1}\]

\textbf{Step 2.}
\emph{Elimination of $xy$ and $y$}.
Factorize the left hand side
\begin{align*}
y\,(y+a_1x+a_3)=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6.
\end{align*}
By translation
\begin{align*}
\boxed{x\mapsto x,\qquad y\mapsto y-\tfrac12(a_1x+a_3)}
\end{align*}
we have
\begin{align*}
y^2-(\tfrac12(a_1x+a_3))^2&=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6,\\
y^2&=x^3+(\tfrac14a_1^2+a_2)x^2+(\tfrac12a_1a_3+a_4)x+(\tfrac14a_3^2+a_6),\\
y^2&=x^3+\frac14(a_1^2+4a_2)x^2+\frac12(a_1a_2+2a_4)x+\frac14(a_3^2+4a_6).
\end{align*}
Introduce new coefficients $b$ to write it as
\begin{align*}
y^2=x^3+\frac14b_2x^2+\frac12b_4x+\frac14b_6.
\end{align*}
By scaling
\begin{align*}
\boxed{x\mapsto x,\qquad y\mapsto \tfrac12y}
\end{align*}
we get
\[y^2=4x^3+b_2x^2+2b_4x+b_6.\tag{2}\]

\textbf{Step 3.}
\emph{Elimination of $x^2$}.
By translation
\begin{align*}
\boxed{x\mapsto x-\tfrac1{12}b_2}
\end{align*}
we have
\begin{align*}
y^2=4\left(x^3-3\cdot\frac1{12}b_2x^2+3\cdot\frac1{12^2}b_2^2x-\frac1{12^3}b_2^3\right)&\\
+b_2\left(x^2-2\cdot\frac1{12}b_2x+\frac1{12^2}b_2^2\right)&\\
+2b_4\left(x-\frac1{12}b_2\right)&\\
+b_6,&
\end{align*}
so
\begin{align*}
y^2&=4x^3+\left(4\cdot3\cdot\frac1{12^2}b_2^2-2\cdot\frac1{12}b_2^2+2b_4\right)x+\left(-4\cdot\frac1{12^3}b_2^3+\frac1{12^2}b_2^3-2\cdot\frac1{12}b_2b_4+b_6\right)\\
&=4x^3+\frac1{12}\left(-b_2^2+24b_4\right)x+\frac1{216}\left(b_2^3-36b_2b_4+216b_6\right).
\end{align*}
Write it as
\begin{align*}
y^2=4x^3-\frac1{12}c_4x-\frac1{216}c_6.
\end{align*}
We want to match the coefficients of $y^2$ and $x^3$ but also want the coefficients of $c_4x$ and $c_6$ to be integers.
Iterative scaling implies
\begin{align*}
x\mapsto\tfrac16x:&\qquad 216y^2=4x^3-3c_4x-c_6\\
y\mapsto\tfrac1{36}y:&\qquad y^2=24x^3-18c_4x-6c_6\\
x\mapsto\tfrac16x:&\qquad 9y^2=x^3-27c_4x-54c_6\\
y\mapsto\tfrac13y:&\qquad y^2=x^3-27c_4x-54c_6.
\end{align*}
Thus, we get the famous third form of Weierstrass equation:
\[y^2=x^3-27c_4x-54c_6.\tag{3}\]



\begin{thm}
Let
\[E:y^2=x^3-Ax-B.\]
TFAE:
\begin{cond}
\item A point $(x,y)$ is a singular point of $E$.
\item $y=0$ and $x$ is a double root of $x^3-Ax-B$.
\item $\Delta=0$.
\end{cond}
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
(1)$\Rightarrow$(2)
$\pd_yf=0$ implies $y=0$. $f=\pd_xf=0$ implies $x$ is a double root of $x^3-Ax-B$.
$A$ determines whether $x$ is either cusp of node.
\end{pf}












































\section{Algebraic integer}
\subsection{Quadratic integer}
\begin{thm}
Every quadratic field is of the form $\Q(\sqrt d)$ for a square-free $d$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
Let $d$ be a square-free.
\[\cO_{\Q(\sqrt d)}=\begin{cases}\Z+\sqrt d\Z&,d\equiv2,3\pmod4\\\bigmath\Z+\frac{1+\sqrt d}2\Z&,d\equiv1\pmod4\end{cases}\]
\[\Delta_{\Q(\sqrt d)}=\begin{cases}4d&,d\equiv2,3\pmod4\\ d&,d\equiv1\pmod4\end{cases}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{ex}
\[\Delta_{\Q(i)}=-4,\quad\Delta_{\Q(\sqrt2)}=8,\quad\Delta_{\Q(\gamma)}=5,\quad\Delta_{\Q(\omega)}=-3\]
where $\gamma:=\frac{1+\sqrt5}2$ and $\omega=\zeta_3$.
\end{ex}
\begin{thm}
Let $\theta^3=hk^2$ for $h,k$ square-free's.
\[\cO_{\Q(\theta)}=\begin{cases}\bigmath\Z+\theta\Z+\frac{\theta^2}k\Z&,m\not\equiv\pm1\pmod9\\
\bigmath\Z+\theta\Z+\frac{\theta^2\pm\theta k+k^2}{3k}\Z&,m\equiv\pm1\pmod9\end{cases}\]
\end{thm}
\begin{cor}
If $\theta^3$ is a square free integer, then
\[\cO_{\Q(\theta)}=\Z[\theta].\]
\end{cor}

\subsection{Integral basis}
\begin{thm}
Let $\alpha\in K$.
$Tr_K(\alpha)\in\Z$ if $\alpha\in\cO_K$.
$N_K(\alpha)\in\Z$ if and only if $\alpha\in\cO_K$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
Let $\{\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n\}$ be a basis of $K$ over $\Q$.
If $\Delta(\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n)$ is square-free, then $\{\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n\}$ is an integral basis.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
Let $\{\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n\}$ be a basis of $K$ over $\Q$ consisting of algebraic integers.
If $p^2\mid\Delta$ and it is not an integral basis, then there is a nonzero algebraic integer of the form
\[\frac1p\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\omega_i.\]
\end{thm}

\subsection{Fractional ideals}
\begin{thm}
Every fractional ideal of $K$ is a free $\Z$-module with rank $[K:\Q]$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
This theorem holds because $K/\Q$ is separable and $\Z$ is a PID.

\end{pf}


\clearpage
\subsection{Frobenius element}
Consider an abelian extension $L/K$.
Let $\fp$ be a prime in $\cO_K$.
Since $L/K$ is Galois, the followings do not depend on the choice of $\fP$ over $\fp$.

\begin{lem}
The following sequence of abelian groups is exact:
\begin{es} 0 \> I(\fP|\fp) \> D(\fP|\fp) \> \Gal(k(\fP)/k(\fp)) \> 0, \end{es}
where $k(\fP):=\cO_L/\fP$ and $k(\fp):=\cO_K/\fp$ are residue fields.
\end{lem}
The Frobenius element is defined as an element of $D(\fP|\fp)/I(\fP|\fp)\cong\Gal(k(\fP)/k(\fp))$, which is a cyclic group.
\begin{defn}
For an unramified prime $\fp\subset\cO_K$ so that $I(\fP|\fp)$ is trivial, the Frobenius element $\phi(\fP|\fp)\in\Gal(L/K)$ is defined by
\[\phi_{\fP|\fp}(\fP)=\fP,\quad\text{and}\quad\phi_{\fP|\fp}(x)\equiv x^{|\cO_K/\fp|}\pmod{\fP}\quad\text{for}\quad x\in\cO_L.\]
\end{defn}
The first condition is equivalent to $\phi_{\fP|\fp}\in D(\fP|\fp)$.
In fact, the Frobenius element is in fact a generator of the cyclic group $D(\fP|\fp)\cong\Gal(k(\fP)/k(\fp))$ by the Galois theory of finite fields.
\begin{rmk}
Fermat's little theorem states
\[\phi_{\fP|\fp}(x)\equiv x\pmod{\fp},\c{for} x\in\cO_K,\]
which means $\phi_{\fP|\fp}$ fixes the field $\cO_K/\fp$ so that $\phi_{\fP|\fp}\in\Gal(k(\fP)/k(\fp))$.
\end{rmk}



\subsection{Quadratic Dirichlet character}
Let $K=\Q(\sqrt D)$ be a quadratic field with discriminant $D$ and $L=\Q(\zeta_D)$ be the cyclotomic field for $\zeta_D=e^{\frac{2\pi i}D}$.
\begin{cd}[column sep = 0pt]
D(\fP/p) & \subset & \Gal(L/\Q) \ep{d}{q} & \cong & (\Z/D\Z)^\x \ep{d}{\chi_K=\left(\frac D\cdot\right)} & \qquad & L=\Q(\zeta_D)\\
D(\fp/p) & \subset & \Gal(K/\Q) & \cong & \{\pm1\} && K=\Q(\sqrt D).
\end{cd}

For $p\nmid D$ so that $p$ is unramified, let $\sigma_p:=(\zeta_D\mapsto\zeta_D^p)\in\Gal(L/\Q)$.
Then, what is $\sigma_p|_K$ in $\Gal(K/\Q)$.
In other words, for $\sigma_p(\zeta_D)=\zeta_D^p$ which is true: $\sigma_p(\sqrt D)=\pm\sqrt D$?

Note that $\sigma$ satisfies the condition to be the Frobenius element: $\sigma_p=\phi_{\fP|p}$.
Therefore, $q(\phi_{\fP|p})=\phi_{\fp|p}=\sigma_p|_K$ is also a Frobenius element.
There are only two cases:
\begin{cond}
\item If $f=|D(\fp/p)|=1$, then $\sigma|_K$ is the identity, so $\chi_K(p)=1$
\item If $f=|D(\fp/p)|=2$, then $\sigma|_K$ is not trivial, so $\chi_K(p)=-1$
\end{cond}

Artin reciprocity: $(\Z/D\Z)^\x$ is extended to $I_K^S$.







\section{Diophantine equations}

\subsection{Quadratic equation on a plane}
Ellipse is reduced by finitely many computations.


Especially for hyperbola, here is a strategy to use infinite descent.
\begin{cond}
\item Let midpoint to be origin.
\item Find the subgroup of $\SL_2(\Z)$ preserving the image of hyperbola(which would be isomorphic to $\Z$).
\item Find an impossible region.
\item Assume a solution and reduce it to the either impossible region or the ground solution.
\end{cond}
\begin{ex}[Pell's equation]
Consider\[x^2-2y^2=1.\]
A generator of hyperbola generating group is $g=\begin{pmatrix}3&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}$.
It has a ground solution $(1,0)$ and impossible region $1<x<3$.
If $(a,b)$ is a solution with $a>0$, then we can find $n$ such that $g^n(a,b)$ is in the region $[1,3)$.
The possible case is $g^n(a,b)=(1,0)$.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}[IMO 1988, the last problem]
Consider a family of equations\[x^2+y^2-kxy-k=0.\]
By the vieta jumping, a generator is $g:(a,b)\mapsto(b,kb-a)$.
It has an impossible region $xy<0$ : $x^2+y^2-kxy-k\ge x^2+y^2>0$.
If $(a,b)$ is a solution with $a>b$, then we can find $n$ such that $g^n(a,b)$ is in the region $xy\le0$.
Only possible case is $g^n(a,b)=(\sqrt k,0)$ or $g^n(a,b)=(0,-\sqrt k)$.
In ohter words, the equation has a solution iff $k$ is a perfect square.
\end{ex}


\clearpage


\subsection{The Mordell equations}
(The reciprocity laws let us learn not only which prime splits, but also which prime factors a given polynomial has.)
\[y^2=x^3+k\]
There are two strategies for the Mordell equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x^2-2x+4$ has a prime factor of the form $4k+3$
\item $x^3=N(y-a)$ for some $a$.
\end{itemize}
First case: $k=7,-5,-6,45,6,46,-24,-3,-9,-12$.
\begin{ex} Solve $y^2=x^3+7$. \end{ex}
\begin{pf}
Taking mod 8, $x$ is odd and $y$ is even.
Consider
\[y^2+1=(x+2)(x^2-2x+4).\]
Since
\[x^2-2x+4=(x-1)^2+3,\]
there is a prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$ that divides the right hand side.
Taking mod $p$, we have
\[y^2\equiv-1\pmod p,\]
which is impossible.
Therefore, the equation has no solutions.
\end{pf}
\begin{ex} Solve $y^2=x^3-2$. \end{ex}
\begin{pf}
Taking mod 8, $x$ and $y$ are odd.
Consider a ring of algebraic integers $\Z[\sqrt{-2}]$.
We have
\[N(y-\sqrt{-2})=(y-\sqrt{-2})(y+\sqrt{-2})=x^3.\]
For a common divisor $\delta$ of $y\pm\sqrt{-2}$, we have 
\[N(\delta)\mid N((y-\sqrt{-2})-(y+\sqrt{-2}))=N(2\sqrt{-2})=|(2\sqrt{-2})(-2\sqrt{-2})|=8.\]
On the other hand,
\[N(\delta)\mid x^3 \equiv1\pmod2,\]
so $N(\delta)=1$ and $\delta$ is a unit.
Thus, $y\pm\sqrt{-2}$ are relatively prime.
Since the units in $\Z[\sqrt{-2}]$ are $\pm1$, which are cubes, $y\pm\sqrt{-2}$ are cubics in $\Z[\sqrt{-2}]$.

Let
\[y+\sqrt{-2}=(a+b\sqrt{-2})^3=a(a^2-6b^2)+b(3a^2-2b^2)\sqrt{-2},\]
so that $1=b(3a^2-2b^2)$.
We can conclude $b=\pm1$.
The possible solutions are $(x,y)=(3,\pm5)$, which are in fact solutions.
\end{pf}



\section{The local-global principle}
\subsection{The local fields}
Let $f\in\Z[x]$.
\[\text{\emph{Does $f=0$ have a solution in $\Z$?}}\]
\[\text{\emph{Does $f=0$ have a solution in $\Z/(p^n)$ for all $n$?}}\]
\[\text{\emph{Does $f=0$ have a solution in $\Z_p$?}}\]
In the first place, here is the algebraic definition.
\begin{defn}
Let $p\in\Z$ be a prime.
The ring of the $p$-adic integers $\Z_p$ is defined by the inverse limit:
\begin{es}
\Z_p:={\bigmath\lim_{\substack{\longleftarrow\\n\in\N}}}\F_{p^n}  \>  \cdots  \>  \Z/(p^3)  \>  \Z/(p^2)  \>  \F_p.
\end{es}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
$\Q_p=\Frac\Z_p$.
\end{defn}
Secondly, here is the analytic definition.
\begin{defn}
Let $p\in\Z$ be a prime.
Define a absolute value $|\cdot|_p$ on $\Q$ by $|p^ma|_p=\frac1{p^m}$.
The local field $\Q_p$ is defined by the completion of $\Q$ with respect to $|\cdot|_p$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
$\Z_p:=\{x\in\Q_p:|x|_p\le1\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Observe
\begin{align*}
3^{-1}&\equiv2_5\pmod5\\
&\equiv32_5\pmod{5^2}\\
&\equiv132_5\pmod{5^3}\\
&\equiv1313132_5\pmod5^7\cdots.
\end{align*}
Therefore, we can write
\[3^{-1}=\overline{13}2_5=2+3p+p^2+3p^3+p^4+\cdots\]
for $p=5$.
Since there is no negative power of 5, $3^{-1}$ is a $p$-adic integer for $p=5$.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}

\begin{align*}
7&\equiv1_3^2\pmod3\\
&\equiv111_3^2\pmod{3^3}\\
&\equiv20111_3^2\pmod{3^5}\\
&\equiv120020111_3^2\pmod{3^9}\cdots.
\end{align*}
Therefore, we can write
\[\sqrt7=\cdots120020111_3=1+p+p^2+2p^4+2p^7+p^8+\cdots\]
for $p=3$.
Since there is no negative power of 3, $\sqrt7$ is a $p$-adic integer for $p=3$.
\end{ex}


There are some pathological and interesting phenomena in local fields.
Actually note that the values of $|\cdot|_p$ are totally disconnected.
\begin{thm}
The absolute value $|\cdot|_p$ is nonarchimedean: it satisfies $|x+y|_p\le\max\{|x|_p,|y|_p\}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Trivial.
\end{pf}

\begin{thm}
Every triangle in $\Q_p$ is isosceles.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
$\Z_p$ is a discrete valuation ring: it is local PID.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
asdf
\end{pf}

\begin{thm}
$\Z_p$ is open and compact.
Hence $\Q_p$ is locally compact Hausdorff.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
$\Z_p$ is open clearly.
Let us show limit point compactness.
Let $A\subset\Z_p$ be infinite.
Since $\Z_p$ is a finite union of cosets $p\Z_p$, there is $\alpha_0$ such that $A\cap(\alpha_0+p\Z_p)$ is infinite.
Inductively, since
\[\alpha_n+p^{n+1}\Z_p=\bigcup_{1\le x<p}(\alpha_n+xp^{n+1}+p^{n+2}\Z_p),\]
we can choose $\alpha_{n+1}$ such that $\alpha_n\equiv\alpha_{n+1}\pmod{p^{n+1}}$ and $A\cap(\alpha_{n+1}+p^{n+2}\Z_p)$ is infinite.
The sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ is Cauchy, and the limit is clearly in $\Z_p$.
\end{pf}



\subsection{Hensel's lemma}

\begin{thm}[Hensel's lemma]
Let $f\in\Z_p[x]$.
If $f$ has a simple solution in $\F_p$, then $f$ has a solution in $\Z_p$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
asdf
\end{pf}

\begin{rmk}
Hensel's lemma says: for $X$ a scheme over $\Z_p$, $X$ is smooth iff $X(\Z_p)\twoheadrightarrow X(\F_p)$....???
\end{rmk}

\begin{ex}
$f(x)=x^p-x$ is factorized linearly in $\Z_p[x]$.
\end{ex}

\subsection{Sums of two squares}


\begin{thm}[Euler]
A positive integer $m$ can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if $v_p(m)$ is even for all primes $p\equiv3\pmod4$.
\end{thm}
\begin{lem}
Let $p$ be a prime with $p\equiv1\pmod4$.
Every $p$-adic integer is a sum of two squares of $p$-adic integers.
\end{lem}











\section{Ultrafilter}

\begin{thm}
Let $\cU$ be an ultrafilter on a set $S$ and $X$ be a compact space.
For $f\colon S\to X$, the limit $\cU$-$\lim f$ always exists.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}
Let $X=\prod_{\alpha\in\cA}X_\alpha$ be a product space of compact spaces $X_\alpha$.
A net $\{f_d\}_{d\in\cD}$ on $X$ has a convergent subnet.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}[1]
Use Tychonoff.
Compactness and net compactness are equivalent.
\end{pf}
\begin{pf}[2]
It is a proof without Tychonoff.
Let $\cU$ be a ultrafilter on a set $\cD$ contatining all $\uparrow d$.
Define a directed set $\cE=\{(d,U)\in\cD\x\cU:d\in U\}$ as $(d,U)\prec(d',U')$ for $U\supset U'$.
Let $f\colon\cE\to X$ be a net defined by $f_{(d,U)}=f_d$.

By the previous theorem, $\cU$-$\lim\pi_\alpha f_d$ exsits for each $\alpha$.
Define $f\in X$ such that $\pi_\alpha f=\cU$-$\lim\pi_\alpha f_d$.
Let $G=\prod_\alpha G_\alpha\subset X$ be any open neighborhood of $f$ where $G_\alpha=X_\alpha$ except finite.
Then $G_\alpha$ is an open neighborhood of $\pi_\alpha f$ so that we have $U_\alpha:=\{d:\pi_\alpha f_d\in G_\alpha\}\in\cU$ by definition of convergence with ultrafilter.9
Since $U_\alpha=\cD$ except finites, we can take an upper bound $U_0\in\cU$.
Then, by taking any $d_0\in U_0$, we have $f_{(d,U)}\in G$ for every $(d,U)\succ(d_0,U_0)$.
This means $f=\lim_\cE f_{(d,U)}$, so we can say $\lim_\cE f_{(d,U)}$ exists.

%WTS f_{(d,U)} is a subnet f_d
\end{pf}

\section{Universal coefficient theorem}
\begin{lem}
Suppose we have a flat resolution
\begin{es}
0 \>  P_1  \>  P_0  \>  A  \> 0.
\end{es}
Then, we have a exact sequence
\begin{es}
\cdots  \>  0  \>  \Tor_1^R(A,B)  \>  P_1\tn B  \>  P_0\tn B  \>  A\tn B  \> 0.
\end{es}
\end{lem}


\begin{thm}
Let $R$ be a PID.
Let $C_\bul$ be a chain complex of flat $R$-modules and $G$ be a $R$-module.
Then, we have a short exact sequence
\begin{es}
0 \>  H_n(C)\tn G  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  \Tor(H_{n-1}(C),G)  \> 0,
\end{es}
which splits, but not naturally.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}[1]
We have a short exact sequence of chain complexes
\begin{es}
0 \>  Z_\bul  \>  C_\bul  \>  B_{\bul-1}  \> 0
\end{es}
where every morphism in $Z_\bul$ and $B_\bul$ are zero.
Since modules in $B_{\bul-1}$ are flat, we have a short exact sequence
\begin{es}
0 \>  Z_\bul\tn G  \>  C_\bul\tn G  \>  B_{\bul-1}\tn G  \> 0
\end{es}
and the associated long exact sequence
\begin{es}
\cdots \>  H_n(B;G)  \>  H_n(Z;G)  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  H_{n-1}(B;G)  \>  H_{n-1}(Z;G)  \> \cdots
\end{es}
where the connecting homomomorphisms are of the form $(i_n\colon B_n\to Z_n)\tn1_G$ (It is better to think diagram chasing than a natural construction).
Since morhpisms in $B$ and $Z$ are zero (if it is not, then the short exact sequence of chain complexes are not exact, we have
\begin{es}
\cdots \>  B_n\tn G  \>  Z_n\tn G  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  B_{n-1}\tn G  \>  Z_{n-1}\tn G  \> \cdots.
\end{es}
Since
\begin{es}
0 \>  \Tor_1^R(H_n,G)  \>  B_n\tn G  \>  Z_n\tn G  \>  H_n\tn G  \> 0
\end{es}
for all $n$, the exact sequence splits into short exact sequence by images
\begin{es}
0 \>  H_n\tn G  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  \Tor_1^R(H_{n-1},G)  \> 0.
\end{es}

For splitting,
\end{pf}

\begin{pf}[2]
Since $R$ is PID, we can construct a flat resolution of $G$
\begin{es}
0 \>  P_1  \>  P_0  \>  G  \> 0.
\end{es}
Since modules in $C_\bul$ are flat so that the tensor product functors are exact and $P_1\to P_0$ and $P_0\to G$ induce the chain maps, we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes
\begin{es}
0 \>  C_\bul\tn P_1  \>  C_\bul\tn P_0  \>  C_\bul\tn G  \> 0.
\end{es}
Then, we have the associated long exact sequence
\begin{es}
\cdots \>  H_n(C;P_1)  \>  H_n(C;P_0)  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  H_{n-1}(C;P_1)  \>  H_{n-1}(C;P_0)  \> \cdots.
\end{es}
Since flat tensor product functor commutes with homology funtor from chain complexes, we have
\begin{es}
\cdots \>  H_n\tn P_1  \>  H_n\tn P_0  \>  H_n(C;G)  \>  H_{n-1}\tn P_1  \>  H_{n-1}\tn P_0  \> \cdots.
\end{es}
Since
\begin{es}

\begin{pf}[3](??)
By tensoring $G$, we get the following diagram.
\begin{cd}[row sep={24pt,between origins}, column sep={36pt,between origins}]
H_n\tn G  \ar{ddr}  &&&& H_{n-1}\tn G \\

\end{cd}
Every aligned set of consecutive arrows indicates an exact sequence.
Notice that epimorphisms and cokernals are preserved, but monomorphisms and kernels are not.
Especially, $\coker\pd_{n+1}\tn G=\coker(\pd_{n+1}\tn1_G)$ is important.

Consider the following diagram.
\begin{cd}[row sep={30pt,between origins}, column sep={60pt,between origins}]
H_n(C;G) \mn{dr} & H_n\tn G \ar{d}&&&\\
& \coker\pd_{n+1}\tn G \ep{dd}\ep{ddrr} && \ker\pd_{n-1}\tn G \ar{dr}{\text{monic!}} & \\

\Tor_1(H_{n-1},G) \mn{ur} &&&&
\end{cd}
Since $\ker\pd_{n-1}$ is free, 

If we show $\im(\pd_n\tn1_G)\to\ker\pd_{n-1}\tn G$ is monic, then we can get
\begin{align*}
H_n(C;G)&=\ker(\coker\pd_{n+1}\tn G\to\im(\pd_n\tn1_G))\\
&=\ker(\coker\pd_{n+1}\tn G\to\ker\pd_{n-1}\tn G).
\end{align*}

\section{Fundamental differential geometry}

\subsection{Manifold and Atlas}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{locally Euclidean space} $M$ of dimension $m$ is a Hausdorff topological space $M$ for which each point $x\in M$ has a neighborhood $U$ homeomorphic to an open subset of $\R^d$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{manifold} is a locally Euclidean space satisfying the one of following equivalent conditions: second countability, blabla%
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{chart} or a \emph{coordinate system} for a locally Euclidean space is a map $\varphi$ is a homeomorphism from an open set $U\subset M$ to an open subset of $\R^d$.
A chart is often written by a pair $(U,\varphi)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
An \emph{atlas} $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection $\mathcal{F}=\{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)\mid\alpha\in A\}$ of charts on $M$ such that $\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha=M$.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
A \emph{differentiable maifold} is a manifold on which a differentiable structure is equipped.
\end{defn}
The definition of differentiable structure will be given in the next subsection.
Actually, a differentiable structure can be defined for a locally Euclidean space.



\subsection{Definition of Differentiable Structure}


\begin{defn}
An atlas $\mathcal{F}$ is called \emph{differentiable} if any two charts $\varphi_\alpha,\varphi_\beta\in\mathcal{F}$ is \emph{compatible}: each \emph{transition function} $\tau_{\alpha\beta}\colon\varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)\to\varphi_\beta(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)$ which is defined by $\tau_{\alpha\beta}=\varphi_\beta\circ\varphi_\alpha^{-1}$ is differentiable.
\end{defn}
It is called a \emph{gluing condition}.

\begin{defn}
For two differentiable atlases $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}'$, the two atlases are \emph{equivalent} if $\mathcal{F}\cup\mathcal{F}'$ is also differentiable.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
An differentiable atlas $\mathcal{F}$ is called \emph{maximal} if the following holds:
if a chart $(U,\varphi)$ is compatible to all charts in $\mathcal{F}$, then $(U,\varphi)\in\mathcal{F}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{differentiable structure} on $M$ is a maximal differentiable atlas.
\end{defn}

To differentiate a function on a flexible manofold, first we should define the differentiability of a function.
A differentiable structure, which is usually defined by a maximal differentiable atlas, is roughly a collection of differentiable functions on $M$.
When the charts is already equipped on $M$, it is natural to define a function $f\colon M\to\R$ differentiable if the functions $f\circ\varphi^{-1}\colon\R^d\to\R$ is differentiable.

The gluing condition makes the differentiable function for a chart is also differentiable for any charts because $f\circ\varphi_\alpha^{-1}=(f\circ\varphi_\beta^{-1})\circ(\varphi_\beta\circ\varphi_\alpha^{-1})
=(f\circ\varphi_\beta^{-1})\circ\tau_{\alpha\beta}$.
If a function $f$ is differentiable on an atlas $\mathcal{F}$, then $f$ is also differentiable on any atlases which is equivalent to $\mathcal{F}$ by the definition of the equivalence relation for differential atlases.
We can construct the equivalence classes respected to this equivalence relation.

Therefore, we want to define a differentiable structure as a one of the equivalence classes.
However the differentiable structure is frequently defined as a maximal atlas for the convenience since each equivalence class is determined by a unique maximal atlas.

\begin{ex}
While the circle $S^1$ has a unique smooth structure, $S^7$ has 28 smooth structures.
The number of smooth structures on $S^4$ is still unknown.
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}
A continuous function $f\colon M\to N$ is differentiable if $\psi\circ f\circ\varphi^{-1}$ is differentiable for charts $\varphi,\psi$ on $M,N$ respectively.
\end{defn}


\subsection{Curves}

\begin{defn}
For $f\colon M\to\R$ and $(U,\phi)$ a chart,
\[df\left(\pd{x^\mu}\right):=\pd{f\circ\phi^{-1}}{x^\mu}.\]
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
Let $\gamma\colon I\to M$ be a smooth curve.
Then, $\dot\gamma(t)$ is defined by a tangent vector at $\gamma(t)$ such that
\[\dot\gamma(t):=d\gamma\left(\pd{t}\right).\]
Let $\phi\colon M\to N$ be a smoth map.
Then, $\phi(t)$ can refer to a curve on $N$ such that
\[\phi(t):=\phi(\gamma(t)).\]
Let $f\colon M\to\R$ be a smooth function.
Then, $\dot f(t)$ is defined by a function $\R\to\R$ such that
\[\dot f(t):=\dd{t}f\circ\gamma.\]
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
Let $\gamma\colon I\to M$ be a smooth curve on a manifold $M$.
The notation $\dot\gamma^\mu$ is not confusing thanks to
\[(\dot\gamma)^\mu=\dot{(\gamma^\mu)}.\]
In other words,
\[dx^\mu(\dot\gamma)=\dd{t}x^\mu\circ\gamma.\]
\end{prop}


\subsection{Connection computation}

\begin{align*}
\nabla_XY&=X^\mu\nabla_\mu(Y^\nu\pd_\nu)\\
&=X^\mu(\nabla_\mu Y^\nu)\pd_\nu+X^\mu Y^\nu(\nabla_\mu\pd_\nu)\\
&=X^\mu\left(\pd{Y^\nu}{x^\mu}\right)\pd_\nu+X^\mu Y^\nu(\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\lambda\pd_\lambda)\\
&=X^\mu\left(\pd{Y^\nu}{x^\mu}+\Gamma_{\mu\lambda}^\nu Y^\lambda\right)\pd_\nu.
\end{align*}
The covariant derivative $\nabla_XY$ does not depend on derivatives of $X^\mu$.

\[Y^\nu_{,\mu}=\nabla_\mu Y^\nu=\pd{Y^\nu}{x^\mu},\qquad Y^\nu_{;\mu}=(\nabla_\mu Y)^\nu=\pd{Y^\nu}{x^\mu}+\Gamma_{\mu\lambda}^\nu Y^\lambda.\]
\begin{thm}
For Levi-civita connection for $g$,
\[\Gamma^l_{ij}=\frac12(\pd_ig_{jk}+\pd_jg_{ki}-\pd_kg_{ij}).\]
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
\begin{align*}
(\nabla_ig)_{jk}&=\pd_ig_{jk}-\Gamma^l_{ij}g_{lk}-\Gamma^l_{ik}g_{jl}\\
(\nabla_jg)_{kl}&=\pd_jg_{kl}-\Gamma^l_{jk}g_{li}-\Gamma^l_{ji}g_{kl}\\
(\nabla_kg)_{ij}&=\pd_kg_{ij}-\Gamma^l_{ki}g_{lj}-\Gamma^l_{kj}g_{il}\\
\end{align*}
If $\nabla$ is a Levi-civita connection, then $\nabla g=0$ and $\Gamma_{ij}^k=\Gamma_{ji}^k$.
Thus,
\[\Gamma^l_{ij}g_{kl}=\frac12(\pd_ig_{jk}+\pd_jg_{ki}-\pd_kg_{ij}).\]
\[\Gamma^l_{ij}=\frac12g^{kl}(\pd_ig_{jk}+\pd_jg_{ki}-\pd_kg_{ij}).\]
\end{pf}



\subsection{Geodesic equation}

\begin{thm}
If $c$ is a geodesic curve, then components of $c$ satisfies a second-order differential equation
\[\dd[2]{\gamma^\mu}{t}+\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^\mu\dd{\gamma^\nu}{t}\dd{\gamma^\lambda}{t}=0.\]
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Note
\[0=\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\dot\gamma=\dot\gamma^\mu\nabla_\mu(\dot\gamma^\lambda\pd_\lambda)
=(\dot\gamma^\nu\pd_\nu\dot\gamma^\mu+\dot\gamma^\nu\dot\gamma^\lambda\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^\mu)\pd_\mu.\]
Since
\[\dot\gamma^\nu\pd_\nu\dot\gamma^\mu=\dot\gamma(\dot\gamma^\mu)=d\dot\gamma^\mu(\dot\gamma)=d\dot\gamma^\mu\circ d\gamma\left(\pd{t}\right)=d\dot\gamma^\mu\left(\pd{t}\right)=\ddot\gamma^\mu,\]
we get a second-order differential equation
\[\dd[2]{\gamma^\mu}{t}+\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^\mu\dd{\gamma^\nu}{t}\dd{\gamma^\lambda}{t}=0\]
for each $\mu$.
\end{pf}

\[
\del\cdot V=\frac1{r^2\sin\theta}\left[  \pd{r}\left(r^2\sin\theta\ V_r\right) + \pd{\theta}\left(r\sin\theta\ V_\theta\right) + \pd{\phi}\left(r\ V_\phi\right)  \right]
\]
\[\Delta u=\frac1{r^2\sin\theta}\left[\pd{r}\left(r^2\sin\theta\pd{r}u\right)+\pd{\theta}\left(\sin\theta\pd{\theta}u\right)+\pd{\phi}\left(\frac1{\sin\theta}\pd{\phi}u\right)\right]\]

Let $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ be an orthogonal coordinate that is \emph{not} normalized.
Then,
\[\sharp=g=\diag(\|\pd_\xi\|^2,\|\pd_\eta\|^2,\|\pd_\zeta\|^2)\]
\[\hat x=\|\pd_x\|^{-1}\ \pd_x=\|\pd_x\|\ dx=\|\pd_y\|\|\pd_z\|\ dy\wdg dz\]
In other words, we get the normalized differential forms in sphereical coordinates as follows:
\[dr,\quad r\,d\theta,\quad r\sin\theta\,d\phi,\quad(r\,d\theta)\wdg(r\sin\theta\,d\phi),\quad(r\sin\theta\,d\phi)\wdg(dr),\quad(dr)\wdg(r\,d\theta).\]

\section{Bundles}
Show that $S^n$ has a nonvanishing vector field if and only if $n$ is odd.
\begin{sol}
Since $S^n$ is embedded in $\R^{n+1}$, the tangent bundle $TS^n$ can be considered as an embedded manifold in $S^n\times\R^{n+1}$ which consists of $(x,v)$ such that $\<x,x\>=1$ and $\<x,v\>=0$, where the inner product is the standard one of $\R^{n+1}$.

Suppose $n$ is odd.
We have a vector field
$(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{n+1};x_2,-x_1,\cdots,-x_n)$
which is nonvanishing.

Conversely, suppose we have a nonvanishing vector field $X$.
Consider a map
\[\phi:S^n\to{X}TS^n\to S^n\x\R^{n+1}\to{\phi}\R^{n+1}\to S^n.\]

The last map can be defined since $X$ is nowhere zero. Since this map satisfies $\<x,\phi(x)\>=0$ for all $x\in S^n$, we can define homotopies from $\phi$ to the identity map and the antipodal map respectively. Therefore, the antipodal map must have positive degree, $+1$, so $n$ is odd.
\end{sol}
