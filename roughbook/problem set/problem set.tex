\subsection{Sequences}
\begin{cond}
\item Show that for a nonnegative sequence $a_n$ if $\sum a_n$ diverges then $\sum\frac{a_n}{1+a_n}$ also diverges.
\item Show that every real sequence has a monotonic subsequence that converges to the limit superior of the original sequence.
\item Show that if a decreasing nonnegative sequence $a_n$ converges to 0 and satisfies $S_n\le1+na_n$ then $S_n$ is bounded by 1.

\begin{cond}
\item Show that if both limits of a function and its derivative at infinity exist then the function vanishes at infinity.
\item Let $f$ be $C^2$ with $f''(c)\ne0$. Defined a function $\xi$ such that $f(x)-f(c)=f'(\xi(x))(x-c)$ with $|\xi-c|\le|x-c|$, show that $\xi'(c)=1/2$.
\item Let $f$ be a $C^2$ function such that $f(0)=f(1)=0$. Show that $\|f\|\le\frac18\|f''\|$.
\item Show that the set of local minima of a convex function is connected.
\item Show that a smooth function such that for each $x$ there is $n$ having the $n$th derivative vanish is a polynomial.
\item Show that if a $C^1$ function $f$ satisfies $f(x)\ne0$ for $x$ such that $f'(x)=0$, then in a bounded set there are only finite points at which $f$ vanishes.
\item Let a function $f$ be differentiable. For $a<a'<b<b'$ show that there exist $a<c<b$ and $a'<c'<b'$ such that $f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)$ and $f(b')-f(a')=f'(c')(b'-a')$.
\item Show that if a sequence of real functions $f_n\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ satisfies $|f(x)-f(y)|\le|x-y|$ whenever $|x-y|\ge\frac1n$, then the sequence has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
\item Let $f$ be a differentiable function on the unit closed interval. Show that if $f(0)=0$ there is $c$ such that $cf'(c)=f(c)$. (Flett)
\item Let $f$ be a differentiable function on the unit closed interval. Show that if $f(0)=0$ there is $c$ such that $cf(c)=(1-c)f'(c)$.
\item Let $f:\R\to\R$ be continuous. Show that $f(x)=c$ cannot have exactly two solutions for every constant $c\in\R$.
\item Show that a continuous function that takes on no value more than twice takes on some value exactly once.
\item Let $f$ be a function that has the intermediate value property. Show that if the preimage of every singleton is closed, then f is continuous.

\item Show that if at least one coefficient in the power series of a holomorphic function at each point is 0 then the function is a polynomial.
\item Show that if a holomorphic function on a domain containing the closed unit disk is injective on the unit circle then so is on the disk.
\item Show that for a holomorphic function $f$ and every $z_0$ in the domain there are $z_1\ne z_2$ such that $\frac{f(z_1)-f(z_2)}{z_1-z_2}=f'(z_0)$.
\item For two linearly independent entire functions, show that one cannot dominate the other.
