\section{Sylow game}
\begin{defn}[Sylow $p$-subgroup]
Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n=p^am$ for a prime $p\nmid m$.
A \emph{Sylow $p$-subgroup} is a subgroup of order $p^a$.
We are going to denote the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups by $\Syl_p(G)$ and the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups by $n_p(G)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[The Sylow theorem]
Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n=p^am$ for a prime $p\nmid m$.
Then,
\[p\mid n_p-1,\qquad n_p\mid m\]
for some $k\in\N$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
\Step{1}[Sylow $p$-subgroups exist]
We apply mathematical induction.
The base step is trivial.
Suppose every finite group of order less than $n$ possesses a Sylow $p$-subgroup.

By applying the orbit-stabilizer theorem for the action $G\acts G$ by conjugation, build the class equation
\[|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_i|G:C_G(g_i)|.\]
There are two cases: $p\mid|Z(G)|$ or $p\nmid|Z(G)|$.

\Case{1}[$p\mid|Z(G)|$]
The group $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $p$ by applying Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups on the center.
Then, the inverse image of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of the quotient group is also a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.

\Case{2}[$p\nmid|Z(G)|$]
Since $p\mid n$, we have $p\nmid|G:C_G(g)|$ for some $g\in G$.
Then, a Sylow $p$-subgroup of the centralizer is also a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.

Therefore, we are done for Step 1.

\bigskip
\Step{2}[Sylow $p$-subgroup that is normal is unique]
Note that $p$ does not divide the order of the quotient group.
Every $p$-subgroup should be contained in the Sylow $p$-subgroup, the kernel of the quotient map.
The Sylow $p$-subgroup is clearly unique.

\bigskip
\Step{3}[Sylow $p$-subgroups get action by conjugation]
Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.
We construct class equations via the orbit-stabilizer theorm for various actions to extract information on $n_p$.
Note that stabilizers in any setwise conjugation action is exactly normalizers.
\begin{cond}
\item The action $P\acts\Syl_p(G)$ gives
\[n_p=1+\sum_i|P:N_P(P_i)|\]
since $P=N_P(P_i)$ implies $P\trianglelefteq N_G(P_i)$ and $P=P_i$.
\item Suppose the action $G\acts\Syl_p(G)$ is not transitive.
Take another Sylow $p$-subgroup $P'$ is not conjugate with $P$ in $G$.
The two actions $P\acts\Orb_G(P)$ and $P'\acts\Orb_G(P)$ gives
\[|\Orb_G(P)|=1+\sum_i|P:N_P(P_i)|=\sum_i|P':N_{P'}(P_i)|.\]
It deduces $|\Orb_G(P)|\equiv0,1\pmod{p}$ simultaneously, which leas a contradiction.
\item The action $G\acts\Syl_p(G)$ gives
\[n_p=|G:N_G(P_i)|\]
for all $P_i\in\Syl_p(G)$ because the action is transitive.
\end{cond}
Then, (1) proves $p\mid n_p-1$, and (3) proves $n_p\mid m$.
\end{pf}

\begin{cor}
Let $G$ be a finite group.
Then,
\begin{cond}
\item every pair of two Sylow $p$-subgroup is conjugate.
\item every $p$-subgroup is contained in a Sylow $p$-subgroup.
\item a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal if and only if $n_p=1$.
\end{cond}
\end{cor}

\begin{thm}
Alternative proof for existence of $p$-groups.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Let $|G|=p^{a+b}m$.
Let $\cP_{p^a}$ be the set of all $p^a$-sets in $G$.
Give $G\acts\cP_{p^a}$ by left multiplication.
Since $v_p(|\cP_{p^a}|)=v_p({p^a(p^bm)\choose p^a})=b$, there is an orbit $\cO$ such that $v_p(|\cO|)\le b$.
We have transitive action $G\acts\cO$ and the stabilizer $H$ satisfies $p^a\mid|G|/|\cO|=|H|$.
Since $H\acts\cO$ trivially, $H\acts A$ for $A\in\cO\subset\cP_{p^a}$.
It is only possible when $H\subset A$, hence $|H|=p^a$.
\end{pf}




By H\"older program, normal subgroups always benefit:
\begin{cond}
\item existence of subgroup of particular order(by extension),
\item contradiction by $n_p$ element counting
\end{cond}
A normal subgroup of a subgroup makes \emph{normalizer lifting} that results in:
\begin{cond}
\item existence of subgroup of particular order(by normalizer),
\item existence of normal subgroup,
\item constraint of $n_p$ by normalizer of Sylow subgroup.
\end{cond}

Find a subgroup of nice order


What we want to find is the \emph{distribution of subgroups} such as their orders, numbers, itersections, normality, and isomorphic types.


In order to show the existence of subgroups of paricular orders:
\begin{cond}
\item use induction and expand class equation
\item extend subgroups of a quotient group
\item get normalizers of Sylow $p$-subgroups
\end{cond}

\begin{cond}
\item get a permutation representation by left multiplication
\item get normalizers or centralizers by class equation
\end{cond}

\begin{cond}
\item count elements
\item compare Sylow $p$-subgroups of prime dominating subgroups
\end{cond}
