I am Ikhan Choi.
I am a math-majored undergraduate student from South Korea.

As you can see, all notes are so poor.

# Notes
A file "note.tex" is just a memo.

## Course notes (crs)
It contains notes for imaginary course lectures.
The purpose of these notes is not to teach.
I made them in order to organize what I have studies for my own purposes, and to use them in mentoring programs.
I think writing them is a kind of my hobby.

## Expository notes (exp)
They are literally expository notes.
Every note is currently incomplete even for the first draft.
Sorry.

## Problem notes (prb)
Nothing goes well.
My initial plan was to fill this foler with problems that I often forget or I made.
It would be also great if these notes become used for a systematic course in the remote future.
