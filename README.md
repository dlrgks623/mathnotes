# Ikhan Choi's mathematics notes

## About

I am Ikhan Choi.

I am a math-majored undergraduate student from South Korea.

I am interested in:
 * Foundations of analysis within a general topological viewpoint.
 * Various applications of functional and harmonic analysis, especially on PDE and physics.
 * Numerical and statistical simulations of physical phenomena.

## Notes


### Course notes (crs)
These notes are written to categorize and converge unorganized knowledge.
The purpose of these notes is not to teach.

| Title                         | Link | 
|-------------------------------|------|
| General Topology (incomplete) | [pdf](https://github.com/ikhanchoi/mathnotes/raw/master/crs/general%20topology/general%20topology.pdf) |

### Expository notes (exp)
Recorded the logical flows or tangle ideas on specific topics.

| Wrong proof on totally bounded uniform space        | [pdf](https://github.com/ikhanchoi/mathnotes/raw/master/exp/wrong%20proof%20on%20totally%20bounded%20uniform%20space/wrong%20proof%20on%20totally%20bounded%20uniform%20space.pdf) |

### Problem notes (prb)
Problems motivate Theories.
Also when we try to acquire an abstract theory, the problem-oriented approaches are often effective on learning process, especially within some branches like differential equations, number theory, and physics.
