\section{Additive category}

There are three main concepts we need to catch:
\begin{cond}
\item zero morphisms and zero object;
\item biproduct;
\item additive functors and enriched functors.
\end{cond}

\subsection{Zeros}
We get started from definitions.
\begin{defn}
A \emph{zero object} is an object which is initial and terminal.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A category is said to have \emph{zero morphisms} if every hom-set contains a specified morphism denoted by 0 that satisfies $0\circ f=0$ and $f\circ 0=0$ for all morphisms $f$.
\end{defn}


In other words, we can say that the existence of zero morphisms is equivalent to $\cat{Set_*}$-enrichment.


\subsection{Biproducts}
Simply saying, biproducts is something that is both product and coproduct.
To define biproduct, we need zero morphisms, so the $\cat{Set_*}$-enrichment will be assumed.

\end{defn}





\subsection{Categories}

Here are definitions of categories in which we are interested.
\begin{defn}
A \emph{pointed category} is a cateogry with a zero object.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{semiadditive category} is a $\cat{CMon}$-enriched category with a zero object.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{additive category} is a $\cat{Ab}$-enriched category with a zero object.
\end{defn}
Note that we have of course several possible ways to give some equivalent definitions.
For example, the following proposition is well-admitted as the definition of semiadditive category.
\begin{thm}
A $\cat{Set_*}$-enriched category is semiadditive if and only if it has all finite biproducts.
\end{thm}

A \emph{preadditive category} is another name of $\cat{Ab}$-enriched category.
