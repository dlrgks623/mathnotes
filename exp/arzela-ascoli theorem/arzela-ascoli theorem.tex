\section{Introduction}
Compactness gives us a notion of a certian ``finiteness'' of a topological space.
When doing analysis, we often encounter situations where we need to check compactness of a subset.
There are a lot of tools, including the Heine-Borel theorem, the Tychonoff theorem, and the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, that make it possible.
In case of continuous function spaces, we have a great solution, the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.

The purpose of this article is to provide varied viewpoints for the compactness and space of continuous functions via the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, which is one of my favorite theorems.
By doing so, we can learn deeper and more generalized understanding of the nature of topologies on continuous function spaces.

For preliminaries, we will discuss on compactness at first.
Next, the definitions and properties of topologies on continuous function spaces are going to be introduced.
After that, various statements with various proofs and some applications of the theorem will follow.




\section{More on compactness}
\subsection{Relative compactness}

\begin{defn}
A uniform space is called \emph{relatively compact} or \emph{precompact} if its completion is compact.
\end{defn}

The relative compactness is in particular useful in uniform spaces.
\begin{prop}
A subset of a complete uniform space, like Banach or Fr\'echet space, is relatively compact if and only if its closure is compact.
\end{prop}
\begin{pf}
In a complete uniform space, the completion can be charaterized as the closure.
\end{pf}
\begin{defn}
A uniform space is called \emph{relatively net compact} if every net has a Cauchy subnet.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A uniform space is called \emph{totally bounded} if for every entourage $E$ there is a finite cover $\{U_i\}$ with $U_i^2\in E$ for each index $i$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
Let $X$ be a uniform space.
The followings are all equivalent:
\begin{cond}
\item $X$ is relatively compact;
\item $X$ is relatively net compact;
\item $X$ is totally bounded.
\end{cond}
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Let $\tld X$ be the completion of $X$.

(1)$\impl$(2).
Every net in $X$ has a subnet that converges in $\tld X$.
The subnet is Cauchy.

(1)$\impl$(3).
Let $E$ be an entourage.
Since $\{U\in\tld X:U^2\in E\}$ is an open cover of $\tld X$, there is a finite subcover $\{U_i\}_i$ of $\tld X$.
Then, $\{U_i\cap X\}_i$ is a finite cover of $X$ satisfying $(U_i\cap X)^2\in E$.

The following two directions use the fact that compactness and net compactness are always equivalent in all topological spaces.
So, if we show every net in $\tld X$ has a Cuachy subnet, then we are done.

(2)$\impl$(1).
Let $\tld x:\cD\to\tld X$ be a net in $\tld X$.
Take a net $x:\cD\x\cU\to X$ such that $x_{(d,E)}$ is $E$-closed to $\tld x_d$, where $\cU$ is the uniquely extended uniformity of $\tld X$ from $X$.
By the assumption, there is a Cuachy subnet $xh:\cE\to[h]\cD\x\cU\to X$ of $x$.
We claim the subnet $\tld xh:\cE\to[h]\cD\x\cU\to\cD\to\tld X$ of $\tld x$ is Cauchy.

In order to show this, take an entourage $E$.
By the Cauchyness, we can find $e_0\in\cE$ such that $h(e_0)=(d_{e_0},E_{e_0})$ satisfies $E_{e_0}\subset E$ and $e,e'>e_0\impl(x_e,x_{e'})\in E$.
Then, we get $(\tld x_e,\tld x_{e'})\in E^3$ because $(\tld x_e,x_e)=(\tld x_{d_e},x_{(d_e,E_e)})\in E_e\subset E_{e_0}\subset E$, $(x_e,x_{e'})\in E$, and $(x_{e'},\tld x_{e'})=(x_{(d_{e'},E_{e'})},\tld x_{d_{e'}})\in E_{e'}\subset E_{e_0}\subset E$.
Therefore, $\tld x:\cE\to\tld X$ is Cauchy.

(3)$\impl$(1).
Clearly, $\tld X$ is totally bounded.
What we are going to show here is that a complete totally bounded space is compact.
Let $\tld x:\cD\to\tld X$ be a net in $\tld X$.


\end{pf}

Empirically, compactness checking problems seem to be fallen into two cases: one is to show both completeness and relative compactness, and the other is to apply Tychonoff's theorem.
Followings are some examples.

\begin{ex}[The Heine-Borel theorem]
A subset of a Euclidean space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}[The Blaschke selection theorem]
Let $H(X)$ be the metric space of nonempty compact subsets of a metric space $X$ with Hausdorff metric.
If $X$ is compact, then $H(X)$ is compact.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}[The Banach-Alaoglu theorem]
Let $X$ be a locally convex space and $X^*$ the continuous dual of $X$ with weak$^*$ topology.
If $B\subset X^*$ satisfies $\sup_{f\in B}|f(x)|<\infty$ for each $x\in X$, then $B$ is compact.
\end{ex}
\begin{pf}
We can embed $X^*$ into $\F^X$.
\end{pf}

\section{Variations on the Arzela-Ascoli theorem}

\begin{thm}[Arzela-Ascoli, conventional version]
Let $X$ be a compact space.
For $(f_n)_{n\in\N}\subset C(X)$, if it is equicontinuous and pointwisely bounded, then there is a subsequence that uniformly converges.
\end{thm}

Let $\cT_p$ be the topology of pointwise convergence and $\cT_c$ be the topology of compact convergence.

\begin{thm}[Arzela-Ascoli, metrized version]
Let $X$ be a hemicompact space and $Y$ be a metric space.
If $\cF\subset C(X,Y)$ is equicontinuous and relatively compact in $\cT_p$, then it is relatively compact in $\cT_c$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Let $\{f_n\}_{n\in\N}$ be a sequence in $\cF$ and $K\subset X$ be a compact.

By equicontinuity, for each $k\in\N$ a finite open cover $\{U_s\}_{s\in S_k}$ with a finite set $S_k\subset K$ can be taken such that $x\in U_s\,\impl\,d(f(x),f(s))<\frac1k$ for all $f\in\cF$.
By the pointwise relative compactness, we can extract a subsequence $\{f_m\}_{m\in\N}$ of $\{f_n\}_n$ such that $\{f_m(s)\}_m$ is Cauchy for each $s\in\bigcup_{k\in\N}S_k$ by the diagonal argument.

For every $\e>0$, let $k=\ceil{\e^{-1}}$ so that $\frac1k\le\e$.
Let $m_{0,s}$ be an index such that $m,m'>m_{0,s}\impl d(f_m(s),f_{m'}(s))<\e$, and define $m_0=\max\{m_{0,s}:s\in S_k\}$.
Then, for arbitrary $x\in K$, we obtain $m,m'>m_0\impl$
\[d(f_m(x),f_{m'}(x))\le d(f_m(x),f_m(s))+d(f_m(s),f_{m'}(s))+d(f_{m'}(s),f_{m'}(x))<3\e\]
by taking $s\in S_k$ such that $x\in U_s$.
Thus, $\{f_m\}_m$ is a subsequence of $\{f_n\}_n$ that is uniformly Cauchy on $K$.
\end{pf}

If $C(X,Y)$ is not metrizable, or if $Y$ is uniform but not metrizable, the subsequence extracting procedure is no more available.

\begin{thm}[Arzela-Ascoli, generalized version]
Let $X$ be a topological space and $Y$ be a uniform space.
If $\cF\subset C(X,Y)$ is equicontinuous and relatively compact in $\cT_p$, then it is relatively compact in $\cT_c$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}[1]
Every net in $F$ has a subnet that is pointwisely Cauchy.
We are going to prove this subnet is in fact uniformly Cauchy on a compact set $K$.

Let $(f_d)_{d\in\cD}$ be the pointwisely Cauchy subnet.
Let $E$ be an entourage in $Y$.
By equicontinuity, a finite open cover $\{U_s\}_{s\in S}$ of $K$ can be taken such that $x\in U_s\impl(f(x),f(s))\in E$ for all $f\in\cF$.
(In here, we do not need to extract a subnet because the subnet is already pointwisely convergent.)
Let $d_{0,s}$ be an index such that $d,d'>d_{0,s}\impl(f_d(s),f_{d'}(s))\in E$, and define $d_0=\max\{d_{0,s}:s\in S\}$.
Then, for arbitrary $x\in K$, we get $d,d'>d_0\impl(f_d(x),f_{d'}(x))\in E^3$ by taking $s\in S$ such that $x\in U_s$.
Thus, $(f_d)_d$ is uniformly Cauchy on $K$.
\end{pf}

\begin{proof}[Proof 2]

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof 3]
We are going to prove the two topologies coincide in $\cF$.
Note that subspace topologies $\cT_p\vert_\cF$ and $\cT_c\vert_\cF$ are also generated by pseudometrics $\rho_{\{x\}}(f,g)=d(f(x),g(x))$ and $\rho_K(f,g)=\sup\{d(f(x),g(x)):x\in K\}$ defined on $\cF$ respectively.
Since $\cT_p\vert_\cF\subset\cT_c\vert_\cF$ clearly, it is enough to show the converse.

Take a subbasis element $B_K(f_0,\e)\cap\cF$ of $\cT_c\vert_\cF$ with $f_0\in\cF$.
By equicontinuity of $\cF$, there is a finite cover $\{U_s\}_{s\in S}$ of a compact subset $K$ such that $x\in U_s\,\impl\,d(f(x),f(s))<\e$ for all $f\in\cF$.

If $f\in\cF$ satisfies $\rho_{\{s\}}(f,f_0)<\e$ for all $s\in S$, then we get
\[\rho_K(f,f_0)\le\sup_{x\in K}d(f(x),f(s))+d(f(s),f_0(s))+\sup_{x\in K}d(f_0(s),f_0(x))<\e\]
by taking $s\in S$ such that $x\in U_s$.
This means
\[\bigcap_{s\in S}B_{\{s\}}(f_0,\e)\subset B_K(f_0,3\e).\]
It implies that the subbasis element contains an open set in $\cT_p\vert_\cF$.
Therefore, $\cT_c\vert_\cF\subset\cT_p\vert_\cF$.
\end{proof}
