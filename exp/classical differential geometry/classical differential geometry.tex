\section{Coordinates and parametrizations}
\begin{defn}
An \emph{$m$-dimensional parametrization} is a smooth map $U\to\R^n$ such that
\begin{cond}
\item $U\subset\R^m$ is open and connected,
\item $\a$ is one-to-one (optional),
\item $d\a$ is nondegenerate; $\{\pd_i\a\}_{i=1}^m$ is linearly independent.
\end{cond}
\end{defn}
The third condition is important; in language of manifolds, the third condition defines what we call \emph{immersed submanifolds}.
We will see that the second condition is not important at all.

\begin{defn}
A \emph{regular curve} is a subset of $\R^n$ that is the image of a one-dimensional parametrization.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{regular surface} is a subset of $\R^n$ that is the image of a two-dimensional parametrization.
\end{defn}





\section{Curves in a space}
\begin{thm}
For every regular curve, there is a parametrization $\a$ such that $\|\a'\|=1$.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Suppose we have a parametrization $\beta:I_t\to\R^d$.
Define $\tau:I_t\to I_s$ such that
\[\tau(t_0):=\int_0^{t_0}\|\beta'(t)\|\,dt.\]
Then, $s$ is a diffeomorphism.
Define $\a:I_s\to\R^d$ by $\a:=\beta\circ\tau^{-1}$.
Then, by the chain rule,
\[\a'=\dd{\a}{s}=\dd{\beta}{t}\dd{\tau^{-1}}{s}=\beta'\left(\dd{\tau}{t}\right)^{-1}=\frac{\beta'}{\|\beta'\|}.\qedhere\]
\end{pf}



\subsection{Frenet-Serret theory}

\subsubsection{Theory}
\begin{defn}
We say a curve parametrized as $\a:I\to\R^3$ is \emph{degenerate} if the normalized tangent vector $\a'/\|\a'\|$ is never locally constant everywhere.
In other words, $\a$ is nowhere straight.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Frenet-Serret frame]
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate curve.
We define \emph{tangent unit vector}, \emph{normal unit vector}, \emph{binormal unit vector} by:
\[\bT(t):=\frac{\a'(t)}{\norm{\a'(t)}},\qquad\bN(t):=\frac{\bT'(t)}{\|\bT'(t)\|},\qquad\bB(t):=\bT(t)\times\bN(t),\]
and \emph{curvature} and \emph{torsion} by:
\[\kappa(t):=\<\bT'(t),\bN(t)\>,\quad\tau(t):=-\<\bB'(t),\bN(t)\>.\]
Note that $\kappa$ cannot vanish by definition.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Frenet-Serret formula]
Let $\a$ be a unit speed nondegenerate curve.
\[\begin{pmatrix}\bT'\\\bN'\\\bB'\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&\kappa&0\\-\kappa&0&\tau\\0&-\tau&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\bT\\\bN\\\bB\end{pmatrix}.\]
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
Note that $\{\bT,\bN,\bB\}$ is an orthonormal basis.

\Step{1}[Show that $\bT',\bB',\bN$ are parallel]
Two vectors $\bT'$ and $\bN$ are parallel by definition.
Since $\<\bT,\bB\>=0$ and $\<\bB,\bB\>=1$ are constant, we have
\[\<\bB',\bT\>=\<\bB,\bT\>'-\<\bB,\bT'\>=0,\qquad\<\bB',\bB\>=\tfrac12\<\bB,\bB\>'=0,\]
which show $\bB'$ and $\bN$ are parallel.
By the definition of $\kappa$ and $\tau$, we have
\[\bT'=\kappa\bN,\qquad\bB'=-\tau\bB.\]

\Step{2}[Describe $\bN'$]
Since
\begin{align*}
\<\bN',\bT\>&=-\<\bN,\bT'\>=-\kappa,\\
\<\bN',\bN\>&=\tfrac12\<\bN,\bN\>'=0,\\
\<\bN',\bB\>&=-\<\bN,\bB'\>=\tau,
\end{align*}
we have
\[\bN'=-\kappa\bT+\tau\bB.\qedhere\]
\end{pf}
\begin{rmk}
Skew-symmetricity in the Frenet-Serret formula is not by chance.
Let $\bX(t)$ be the curve of orthogonal matrices $(\bT(t),\bN(t),\bB(t))^T$.
Then, the Frenet-Serret formula reads
\[\bX'(t)=A(t)\bX(t)\]
for a matrix curve $A(t)$.
Since $\bX(t+h)=R_t(h)\bX(t)$ for a family of orthogonal matrices $\{R_t(h)\}_h$ with $R_t(0)=I$, we can describe $A(t)$ as 
\[A(t)=\left.\dd{R_t}{h}\right\rvert_{h=0}.\]
By differentiating the relation $R_t^T(h)R_t(h)=I$ with respect to $h$, we get to know that $A(t)$ is skew-symmetric for all $t$.
In other words, the tangent space $T_I\SO(3)$ forms a skew symmetric matrix.
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate space curve.
\[\kappa=\frac{\|\a'\x\a''\|}{\|\a'\|^3},\qquad\tau=\frac{\a'\x\a''\cdot\a'''}{\|\a'\x\a''\|}.\]
\end{prop}
\begin{pf}
If we let $s=\|\a'\|$, then
\begin{align*}
\a'&=s\bT,\\
\a''&=s'\bT+s^2\kappa\bN,\\
\a'''&=(s''-s^3\kappa^2)\bT+(3ss'\kappa+s^2\kappa')\bN+(s^3\kappa\tau)\bB.
\end{align*}
Now the formulas are easily derived.
\end{pf}

\subsubsection{Problems}

Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate unit speed space curve, and let $\{\bT,\bN,\bB\}$ be the Frenet-Serret frame for $\a$.
Consider a diagram as follows:
\begin{cd}
\<\a,\bT\>=\ ?\ar{r}\ar{d} & \<\a,\bN\>=\ ? \ar{l}\ar{d}\ar{r} & \<\a,\bB\>=\ ? \ar{l}\ar{d} \\
\<\a',\bT\>=1 & \<\a',\bN\>=0 &\<\a',\bB\>=0.
\end{cd}
Here the arrows indicate which information we are able to get by differentiation.
For example, if we know a condition
\[\<\a(t),\bT(t)\>=f(t),\]
then we can obtain by differentiating it
\[\<\a(t),\bN(t)\>=\frac{f'(t)-1}{\kappa(t)}\]
since we have known $\<\a',\bT\>$ but not $\<\a,\bN\>$, and further
\[\<\a(t),\bB(t)\>=\frac{\left(\frac{f'(t)-1}{\kappa(t)}\right)'+\kappa(t)f(t)}{\tau(t)}\]
since we have known $\<\a,\bT\>$ and $\<\a',\bN\>$ but not $\<\a,\bB\>$.
Thus, $\<\a,\bT\>=f$ implies
\[\a(t)=f(t)\cdot\bT+\frac{f'(t)-1}{\kappa(t)}\cdot\bN+\frac{\left(\frac{f'(t)-1}{\kappa(t)}\right)'+\kappa(t)f(t)}{\tau(t)}\cdot\bB.\]

Suggested a strategy for space curve problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formulate the assumptions of the problem as the form
\[\<\ \text{(interesting vector)},\ \text{(Frenet-Serret basis)}\ \>\ =\ \text{(some function)}.\]
\item Aim for finding the coefficients of the position vector in the Frenet-Serret frame, and obtain relations of $\kappa$ and $\tau$ by comparing with assumptions.
\item Heuristically find a constant vector and show what you want directly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}[Plane curves]
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate curve in $\R^3$.
TFAE:
\begin{cond}
\item the curve $\a$ lies on a plane,
\item $\tau=0$,
\item the osculating plane constains a fixed point.
\end{cond}
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}[Helices]
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate curve in $\R^3$.
TFAE:
\begin{cond}
\item the curve $\a$ is a helix,
\item $\tau/\kappa=\const$,
\item normal lines are parallel to a plane.
\end{cond}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Sphere curves]
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate curve in $\R^3$.
TFAE:
\begin{cond}
\item the curve $\a$ lies on a sphere,
\item $(1/\kappa)^2+((1/\kappa)'/\tau)^2=\const$,
\item $\tau/\kappa=(\kappa'/\tau\kappa^2)'$,
\item normal planes contain a fixed point.
\end{cond}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Bertrand mates]
Let $\a$ be a nondegenerate curve in $\R^3$.
TFAE:
\begin{cond}
\item the curve $\a$ has a Bertrand mate,
\item there are two constants $\lambda\ne0,\mu$ such that $1/\lambda=\kappa+\mu\tau$.
\end{cond}
\end{ex}


\subsection{Example problems}
Here we give an example solution of several problems.

\begin{ex}
A space curve whose normal lines always pass through a fixed point lies in a circle.
\end{ex}
\begin{pf}
\Step{1}[Formulate conditions]
Reparametrize $\a$ to become a unit speed curve.
By the assumption, there is a constant point $p\in\R^3$ such that the vectors $\a-p$ and $\bN$ are parallel so that we have
\[\<\a-p,\bT\>=0,\qquad\<\a-p,\bB\>=0.\]
Our goal is to show that $\|\a-p\|$ is constant and there is a constant vector $v$ such that $\<\a-p,v\>=0$.

\Step{2}[Collect information]
Differentiate $\<\a-p,\bT\>=0$ to get
\[\<\a-p,\bN\>=-\frac1\kappa.\]
%\[\<\a-p,\bN\>=\frac1\kappa\<\a-p,\bT'\>=\frac1\kappa(\<\a-p,\bT\>'-\<\a',\bT\>)=-\frac1\kappa.\]
Differentiate $\<\a-p,\bB\>=0$ to get
\[\tau=0.\]

\Step{3}[Complete proof]
We can deduce that $\|\a-p\|$ is constant from
\[(\|\a-p\|^2)'=\<\a-p,\a-p\>'=2\<\a-p,\bT\>=0.\]
Also, if we heuristically define a vector $v:=\bB$, then $v$ is constant since
\[v'=-\tau\bN=0,\]
and clearly $\<\a-p,v\>=0$
\end{pf}


\begin{ex}
A sphere curve of constant curvature lies in a circle.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
A curve is a circular helix iff it has more than one Bertrand mates.
\end{ex}
