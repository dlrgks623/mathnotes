\section{Quadratic equations}


\begin{prb}
Consider a family of diophantine equations:
\[x^2+y^2-kxy-k=0\]
for $k\in\Z$.
\begin{cond}
\item Show that if $(a,b)$ is a solution, then $(b,b-ka)$ is also a solution.
\item Show that the equation does not have a solution in the region $xy<0$.
\item Show that if it has a solution, then there is a solution on the $x$-axis.
\item Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Conclude that if $ab+1$ divides $a^2+b^2$, then \[\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}\]is a perfect square.
\end{cond}
\end{prb}
\begin{sol}
\item
\item
Suppose $x,y\in\Z$ satisfy $xy<0$.
Since $xy\le-1$,
\[x^2+y^2-kxy-k\ge x^2+y^2+k-k>0.\]
\item
\end{sol}


\begin{prb}
Consider a diophantine equation:
\[y^2=x^3+7.\]
Suppose $(x,y)$ is a solution.
\begin{cond}
\item Show that $x$ is even and $y$ is odd.
\item Show that $x^3+8$ is divided by a prime $p$ such that $p\equiv3\pmod{4}$.
\item Show that the equation has no solutions.
\end{cond}
\end{prb}
